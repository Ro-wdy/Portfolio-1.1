                <p>Hi, I’m Rhodah Mulera, a Software Engineer in training and a Web Developer with a background
                    in
                    Mathematics and Computer Science at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
                    (JKUAT) and a student at Alx. I am passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly, and
                    impactful digital
                    solutions that transform ideas into reality.</p>
                <p>What makes me unique is my ability to blend analytical problem-solving with creativity. I
                    often
                    sketch out user interface ideas before turning them into code, allowing me to design
                    solutions
                    that are both functional and visually engaging. My experience in teaching, leadership, and
                    volunteering has also shaped me into a communicator and collaborator who thrives in diverse
                    teams.</p>
                <p>I am deeply passionate about software development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. These
                    areas excite me because they challenge me to continuously learn, adapt, and innovate. For
                    me,
                    software engineering is not just a career path—it is the way I get to live out my passion
                    for
                    building secure, scalable, and user-centered systems that make a difference in people’s
                    lives.
                </p>
                <p>A fun fact about me: when I get stuck while coding, I sometimes talk to my computer as if it
                    were
                    my teammate—and surprisingly, it often helps me figure things out!</p>
